        change without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Access to these services</h2>
    <p>IcyTape is intended for users who are over the age of 13. However, some of the materials on this site are only
        intended for those over the age of 18. If you are not over the age of 18, you must click Exit when you are
        presented with the notice that such materials are for adults only. Additionally, if you are in the European

        use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.

    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
    <p>You should periodically review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which governs your visits to Icytape,

        understand our information collection and use practices.
    </p>
    <p>To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create an account and provide us with a username,
        password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the <a href="/privacy">Privacy
            Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to
        Your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and promptly notify IcyTape if you discover or
        suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong
        password that is used only with the Services.
    </p>
    <p>You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.</p>

    <h2>Your Content</h2>
    <p>The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials (“Content”),
        including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We
        take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of Your Content.
    </p>
    <p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and
        authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are
        responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all
        necessary rights.
    </p>
    <p>You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant IcyTape the following license to use that
        Content.</p>
    <p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free,
        perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sub licensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt,
        prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or
        likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later
        developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast,
        distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with IcyTape. You
        also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and
        assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
    </p>
    <p>Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about IcyTape or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary,
        and you agree that IcyTape may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to
        you.
    </p>
    <p>Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete
        or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a violation of
        our <a href="/content-policy">Content Policy</a>, or if you otherwise create liability for us.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Party Content, and Advertisements</h2>
    <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by
        advertisers,
        our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content is not under our
        control, and we are not responsible for any of their websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party
        Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any
        transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.</p>
    <p>The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of
        advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in

            the materials subject to the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Moderators</h2>
    <p>Moderating a IcyTape is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are
        not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We recognize that moderation can take some work, so we may
        change the features or abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice. We reserve
        the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including
        for a breach of these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>If you choose to moderate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You agree that when you receive reports related to your community, that you will take action to moderate by
            removing content and/or escalating to the admins for review;
        </li>
        <li>You may not represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of IcyTape LLC.;
        </li>

        <li>You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of IcyTape without our written approval;
        </li>

        <li>You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third parties;
        </li>

        <li>If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating, you will use such information only
            in connection with your performance as a moderator; and
        </li>

        <li>You may create and enforce rules provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, our <a
                href="/content-policy">Content Policy</a>, and our Community Guidelines.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>IcyTape reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if IcyTape
        believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of IcyTape or the IcyTape community.
    </p>
