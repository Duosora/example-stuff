    <h1>IcyTape Content Policy</h1>

    <p>IcyTape is a platform for individuals to discuss, connect, and share in an open environment, home to some of the
        most authentic content anywhere online. The nature of this content might be funny, serious, offensive, or
        anywhere in between. While participating, it’s important to keep in mind this value above all others: show
        enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy IcyTape for what it is.
    </p>

    <h2>Unwelcome content</h2>
    <p>While IcyTape generally provides a lot of leeway in what content is acceptable, here are some guidelines for
        content that is not. Please keep in mind the spirit in which these were written, and know that looking for
        loopholes is a waste of time.
