    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>No spam. No cross-posting. No duplicate posts. All automated messages, advertisements, and links to competitor websites will be deleted immediately.</li>
        
        <li>Post in relevant categories only. Messages posted in the wrong topic area will be removed and placed in the
            correct sub-forum by moderators.</li>

        <li>Respect other users. No flaming or abusing fellow forum members. Users who continue to post inflammatory,
            abusive comments will be deleted from the forum after two warnings are issued by moderators.</li>

        <li>Harassment. No threats or harassment of other users will be tolerated. Any instance of threatening or
            harassing behavior is grounds for deletion from the forums.</li>

        <li>Illegal content. No re-posting of copyrighted materials or other illegal content is allowed. Any posts
            containing illegal content or copyrighted materials will be deleted. Please view our Content Policy.</li>

        <li>Do not post copyrighted materials (articles, videos, audio, etc.) that you do not have permission to
            reproduce or distribute.</li>

        <li>When posting and linking to images, videos, files, etc., please refrain from hotlinking. This is the direct
            linking to of images (.jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, etc.), video (.avi, .mov, .mpg, .mpeg, .wmv, etc.), audio
            (.mp3, .wav, etc.), archives (.zip, .rar, etc.) or otherwise downloadable or streamable files, on servers
            that you do not have permission to link to, instead of linking to the page where the item can be found.</li>

        <li>Keep your personal information personal. Do not demand of or continually press other users for personal
            information</li>

        <li>We know that people will have to leave our community (of their own free will or otherwise) from time to time
            and to that end, we do not delete accounts, posts or other content posted on our community. All content is
            granted to us with perpetual electronic publishing rights because any content posted on this community
            becomes a part of the community, even if you no longer are. You may request an item to be removed at any
            time, but we will decide when and if to remove content from our community. If you wish to no longer be
            identified with our community, we will be glad to close your account and alter your profile information to
            remove all identifying characteristics. After account closure, you will no longer be able to participate in
            this community and this action is not reversible.</li>

        <li>Automated account creation, participation and content scraping is not permitted.</li>

        <li>If you ever need clarification on any part of our User Guidelines or have a question, suggestion, a bit of
            feedback or a problem with the site, please feel free to contact me directly to ensure that it receives the
            proper attention. Please do not post it in the forums as it will be removed.</li>

        <li>Moderators and the administrator have the final say on anything. If you have a problem, you may make a
            complaint to them directly and not publicly on the website.</li>
    </ol>
